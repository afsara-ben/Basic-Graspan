# Basic-Graspan

Paper Link: https://aftabhussain.github.io/documents/pubs/asplos17-graspan.pdf

This is a basic implementation of the main function of Graspan, which has a worst case time complexity of O(V*E) and best case time complexity of O(E) where 
V = set of all vertices in given graph
E = set of all edges in given graph

I have considered only one grammar rule C:AB and this is hard coded in the implementation. (code for general grammar rule will be added later)
